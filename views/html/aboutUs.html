        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to the DOESTHISLOOKNORMAL little shop of the weird and random. Brought to you by Dan and Kate a husband and wife team that started this shop once our kids became too old to care about hanging out with us anymore. We took that sadness, bottled it up, shoved it way down and used it as our motivation to finally find a hobby we both enjoy doing. And it only took like 15 years to finally get that motivation. Better late than never as they say. Kate and I have always been a weirdly creative duo. We both enjoy the weird and stranger side of things. So, we thought we’d bring that strangeness into our shop and I think it shows a bit. We aren’t selling things that are particularly useful, they won’t change the world in any way, and they definitely won’t earn you anything more than a few strange glances as someone see’s our items in your living spaces. BUT, know that these items were made with love and in the hopes that it brought you a little joy, whether it be a smirk or a laugh. That’s all we really set out to do in the end (and to fill the void left in our lives from our kids not thinking we are cool anymore). Please enjoy and come back daily, weekly or monthly to find new items and maybe even some light blogging, who knows, we got a lot of time on our hands.
