# DoesThisLookNormal
This website was build using Javascsript, Sass, Mailgun, HTML, Bootstrap, Pug, JSON, Jquery and Ecwid.
This webpage was for a small business owner who wanted to sell things on their own personal website rather than go through Etsy. 
The website is being hosted through Heroku to manage costs vs viability. 
Ecwid is used to maintain items from the shop and provide a way for customers to purchase items, see views/html/shop.html for code.
Mix between Ecwid's own onboard styling and HTML/CSS styling used on their website in order to personalize look of the shop.
Pug is only used to maintain layout throughout website.
Mailgun is used to send email to owner of the shop to create custom items. See views/html/index.html for Jquery code and Routes/mailhandler.JS for code. 


As of 09/21 shop is down for maintance while owner had to take a break due to post surgery complications.
